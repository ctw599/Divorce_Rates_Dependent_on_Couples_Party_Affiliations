Hypothesis: Couples with different political party affiliations have a higher divorce rate than couples with the same political party affiliations.
	    In order to prove my hypothesis, I used the Ohio State voting records. There are voting records from the year 2018 and voting records from the year 2020. The data includes a person's party affiliation - only the Republican and Democrat parties were considered in this project. The data does not include information on spouses and so I manipulated the data to find the marriages. I did this by checking for common last names and addresses. Using spark, I aggregated the couples with the same last name and same address and checked the age gap between them. If the age gap was one that was reasonable for marriage, I deemed the couple married and added them to my newly configured data set. Once I collected the married couples for both the 2018 data set as well as the 2020 data set, I split the 2018 data set into two groups - couples with differing political affiliations and couples with the same political affiliations.
   The goal was to see if the divorce rate was higher in couples of different political views, therefore I needed to check the divorce rates of the couples with the same political views as well in order to compare the two. I then ran the 2018 data through a program that compared the spouses in 2018 to the spouses in 2020 to check if they were the same. If they were indeed the same, I moved on to the next couple to examine. If they were different, I ensured that it was a divorce and not a death. In order to do that I ran the 2020 data and just extracted every person as an individual. If a person from the 2018 data no longer had a matching spouse in the 2020 data, I checked to ensure that they were both alive and thus could conclude that it was a divorce that separated the couple. If a person was not in the 2020 data set, I assumed they died (this is not necessarily a fair assumption, because they could have easily just moved out of state).
    When plotting my bar graph, I debated plotting the number of married couples with differing political affiliations and couples with the same political affiliations up again couples that were still married 2 years later, or up against the number of couples divorced two year later. In the end I decided to compare the number of couples married to the number of couples divorced two years later, because I concluded that it was more in line with my hypothesis.The results seemed to support the hypothesis but to a very small extent, that is probably not very conclusive. It appeared in the graph that couples with differing political views had a 25% divorce rate, whereas couples with the same political views seemed to have a 17% divorce rate. It is interesting just to note how few couples get married with different political affiliations.
    Another important note in regard to the MakeFile - in regard to saving a file from spark and running the makefile. Spark saves a file in a directory. If the directory already exists before the spark program runs, the spark program will crash. The two directories, "olderData" and "newerData" cannot exist prior to the spark program running.
